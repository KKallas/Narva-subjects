# MG400 rakis — system description (version F)

Reference for anyone (human or AI) designing parts that live on this rig: input holders, workpiece fixtures, output holders, and powered "smart" modules. The Fusion design is `MG 400 rakis.f3z` in this folder. Source of truth: `build_rakis_F.py` (Fusion 360 API script) and the `F_report.json` it writes. If the script parameters change, regenerate this file.

## 1. What the rig is

A portable, shippable work table for a Dobot MG400 desktop cobot, used as a rental kit in schools. Everything is 3D printed (PLA, Bambu Lab X1C, bed 256 × 256 mm) except two 16 mm pipes and two short pipe dowels. Nothing is glued; it assembles from flat-packed parts with no tools.

Three functional zones, all on one flat top surface:

* **Nest:** the plate the robot stands in. A self-centering pocket with a 20° ramp wall: if the robot is shoved it climbs the ramp and slides out; pushed back roughly, gravity drops it into exactly the same place. Students should not design anything that touches or fills the nest pocket or ramp.
* **Grid:** a 7 × 10 Gridfinity baseplate (42 mm pitch) in front of the robot. Every holder, fixture or module is a Gridfinity bin that drops into this grid. This is the only interface students design against.
* **Under-grid cable space:** the grid is an open-bottom ("lite") lattice standing on the table, with arches through every wall, so cables from powered modules run underneath and exit at the grid edges.

## 2. Coordinate system (model frame, mm)

* Origin: J1 axis of the robot, at the robot's bottom face (robot floor).
* +X points to the back (behind the robot). The working area is at −X (in front).
* +Y is the operator's left when standing in front of the rig facing the robot; −Y is the operator's right.
* +Z up. Key heights:

| level | z (mm) |
| :--- | :--- |
| table surface | −16.72 |
| robot floor (nest pocket floor) | 0.00 |
| top surface of grid and nest rim | +7.28 |
| bottom of Gridfinity pocket profile | +2.63 |
| pipe tunnels (square, 16.4 mm) | −15.12 … +1.28 |

All rig parts are 24 mm tall (table to top surface).

Robot frame: assumed X_robot = −x, Y_robot = −y (robot rotated 180° about Z relative to the model). The MG400's own Z zero is not at the base bottom. This mapping is unverified: always calibrate with one touch-off on a known cell (see §7) before trusting computed coordinates.

## 3. The robot (Dobot MG400)

* 4 axes (J1 base rotation, J2/J3 arm, J4 tool rotation), tool flange points straight down.
* Max reach 440 mm from J1 axis (less near table height; treat ≤ 400 mm as safe). J1 range ±160°.
* Payload 500 g rated, 750 g max, including the end effector.
* Repeatability ±0.05 mm. The rig's position repeatability (nest, printed parts, Gridfinity fit) is about ±0.3–0.5 mm, so holders must guide parts in with chamfers/lead-ins; don't design for zero clearance.
* Collision detection stops the arm at roughly 12 N of contact force.
* Base footprint 190 × 190 mm, centred on J1.

## 4. The grid, cell addressing and coordinates

* Pitch 42 mm. 7 columns (depth) × 10 rows (width) = 70 cells, 294 × 420 mm.
* Columns 1–7: 1 is nearest the robot, 7 is farthest (front edge of rig).
* Rows A–J: A is the operator's right (−Y), J the operator's left (+Y).
* Cell centre: x = −139.5 − 42·(col − 1), y = −189 + 42·(row_index) with A = 0 … J = 9.
* Grid edges: x from −118.5 (touching the nest) to −412.5; y from −210 to +210.

Practical reach zones (radius from J1):

* Best accuracy / work zone: r ≤ 300 mm: columns 1–3, rows C–H. Put the workpiece fixture (where the actual operation happens) here.
* Normal: 300–400 mm: fine for input/output holders.
* Near the limit: > 400 mm: cells A7, B7, C7, H7, I7, J7 (radii 405–435 mm); avoid for anything that needs depth or accuracy.

Recommended layout convention for lessons: input holder on one side (rows A–C), workpiece fixture in the middle (rows D–G, columns 1–3), output holder on the other side (rows H–J). The arm then sweeps in one direction through the process.

## 5. Designing a holder (Gridfinity bin rules)

Every holder is a standard Gridfinity bin, so it inherits the grid's position.

* Footprint per unit: 42 mm pitch, bin outer size 42·n − 0.5 mm (41.5 mm for 1 unit), outer corner radius 3.75 mm.
* Bin base (bottom foot of each unit): standard Gridfinity foot, profile 0.8 / 1.8 / 2.15 mm (45° / vertical / 45°), 4.75 mm tall. Use an existing Gridfinity generator or library for the foot; do not redraw it by eye.
* The bin's underside sits at about z = +2.6 and the top of its foot about 0.1 mm above the grid top (z ≈ +7.4). Measure on the real rig before relying on Z.
* Height in Gridfinity units of 7 mm is conventional but not required.
* Multi-cell bins (2×1, 2×2, 3×2…) are fine and stiffer. Keep any single printed part ≤ 250 × 250 mm.
* Optional 6 × 2 mm magnets in the foot for extra hold.
* Holders must not rise into the arm's path between other cells: keep tall features (> 60 mm) away from the robot's sweep, and check clearance for the tool and the part it carries.

What each holder type must do:

* **Input holder** presents raw parts at a known, repeatable pick pose: pocket or tray with 1–2 mm clearance and 45° lead-in chamfers at the top, a defined datum (corner or centre) the robot picks from, optionally a gravity-feed stack or ramp so the pick point never moves.
* **Workpiece fixture** holds a part still while the robot works on it (gluing, drawing, pressing, inspecting): locate the part on 3 points or 2 edges plus a floor, so it can only sit one way; resist the tool's force (the robot can push a few N); leave access for the tool from above; make the fixture's datum easy to touch off with the robot.
* **Output holder** receives finished parts: generous lead-ins (the robot places less precisely than it picks), or a chute/bin the part can simply be dropped into.

## 6. Powered and "smart" modules

* Cells are open underneath down to the table: free height under a cell is about 19 mm (table z −16.72 to profile bottom z +2.63); the opening in each cell bottom is 36.3 × 36.3 mm.
* Every grid wall has a 24 mm wide × 12 mm high arch at table level, so cables can run under the whole grid in any direction and exit at the grid edges.
* Cables are routed down through the cell under the module, then along the arches. Keep connectors small enough to pass a 24 × 12 mm arch (JST, Dupont, USB-C cable fine; full-size USB-A plugs are borderline).
* Obstructions under the grid (no free passage there):
  * pipe beams at y = ±110.5 (22.4 mm wide, from the table up to z +2.48), running the whole grid depth. They partly block the openings of rows C and H.
  * two short dowel beams across the centre line (y −40 … +40, 22.4 mm wide): one on the boundary between columns 2 and 3, one under the middle of column 6.
* Electronics that sit in the module go above the grid (inside the bin); only wires go below. Typical boards: ESP32 / M5Stack Atom (the course standard), sensors, servos, pressure sensors for the syringe dispenser, etc.

## 7. Calibration procedure (for instructions to include)

1. Put a 1×1 "calibration bin" with a sharp centre point or cross-hair in a known cell (suggested D2, close and accurate).
2. Jog the robot tool tip onto it and record the robot coordinates.
3. Offset = recorded − computed (from §4 with the frame mapping in §2).
4. Apply the same offset to every cell. Check one far cell (e.g. H5) to verify the rotation/mapping; if it's off by more than ~1 mm the frame mapping in §2 is wrong and must be fixed (rotation sign or axis swap).
5. Z: touch the grid top surface once; bins sit at a known height relative to it.

## 8. Physical build of the rig (for context)

* **Nest:** two halves (nest_front, nest_back, split at x = 0), each 128.5 × 253 mm. Made of 2 mm slices on a 12 mm pitch joined only by square tubes around the pipes; 20 mm hollow end blocks carry the front/back ramp. Pocket = robot outline + 0.5 mm; ramp 20° over 20 mm; 3 mm flat rim.
* **Grid:** four tiles (grid_pos_0, grid_neg_0 168 × 210 mm; grid_pos_1, grid_neg_1 126 × 210 mm), split at y = 0 and between columns 4 and 5.
* **Pipes:** two 16 mm OD pipes at y = ±110.5, length = table depth − 30 mm (670 mm for a 700 mm table), through square 16.4 mm tunnels in nest and grid. Two 70 mm dowels of the same pipe join the left and right grid tiles.
* **L brackets:** printed L at each pipe end hook over the front and back table edges; the back pair presses against the nest, fixing the robot to the back table edge. Clamps go on the L's flat top.
* **Printing:** all parts top-up, no supports. Lesson learned: large solid blocks warp (PLA); keep holders hollow/ribbed, avoid solid masses > ~20 mm thick, use brims or mouse ears on parts > ~150 mm.

## 9. Constraints checklist for any student part

- [ ] Fits in whole Gridfinity units; standard foot; outer 42n − 0.5.
- [ ] Sits inside the safe reach (≤ 400 mm) and the J1 ±160° sweep.
- [ ] Part + holder datum defined; lead-in chamfers on every receiving surface.
- [ ] Gripper/tool approach path clear from above; no tall walls on the robot side.
- [ ] Mass the robot moves (tool + part) ≤ 500 g.
- [ ] Printable on 256 × 256 bed without supports; no thick solid blocks.
- [ ] Cables (if any) go down through the cell and along the 24 × 12 mm arches, avoiding the pipe beams (rows C/H edge) and dowel beams.
- [ ] Calibrated position written down as cell name + offset, not raw coordinates.
